# üß† RAG-Toolkit

A modular, GPU-accelerated Retrieval-Augmented Generation system built for [Critical AI](https://criticalai.in/). This toolkit integrates a FastAPI backend and a Streamlit frontend, with support for `llama-cpp-python` LLMs and custom embeddings.

Everything runs completely locally, and offline, protecting your data, and removing any privacy concerns.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup
1. We recommend using Anaconda for environment management.

2. Create the environment using the provided environment.yml, and activate it:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ragEnv
npm install -g tileserver-gl-light
```
3. Ensure the following are installed:

    - Node.js
    - Microsoft C++ Build Tools (via Visual Studio Build Tools)
    - NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (matching your GPU driver and CUDA version)

4. Install llama-cpp-python with CUDA compatibility, by following the below instructions:
```
call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
where cl
where cmake
set CMAKE_ARGS=-DGGML_CUDA=ON
set FORCE_CMAKE=1
pip install llama-cpp-python --no-cache-dir --verbose
```
#### Note: Installation of llama-cpp-python can take well over an hour.
