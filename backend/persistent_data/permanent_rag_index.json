After all, the July 2006 Mumbai commuter train bombings yielded 209 deaths. There \nwas no use of unconventional weapons. And it was not the ﬁrst time terrorists had landed by \nsea in Mumbai. Nevertheless, some aspects of this attack were signiﬁcant, namely, its auda-\nc","21":"f this attack were signiﬁcant, namely, its auda-\ncious and ambitious scope, the complexity of the operation, and the diversity of its targets. The \nprolonged nature of the episode, which went on for 60 hours with the steadily mounting death \ntoll, made it a slow-motion shoot-out and siege that mesmerized the world’s news media.\nGiven previous terrorist attacks in India, it was not diﬃcult to situate the motives for the \nMumbai attack in the continuing Islamist terrorist campaign.

More \npragmatically, a terrorist attack on India can exacerbate antagonisms between India’s Hindu \nand Muslim communities and provoke Hindu reprisals that, in turn, divide India and facilitate \nrecruiting by Islamist extremists.\nWhy Mumbai?
