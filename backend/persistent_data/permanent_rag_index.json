After all, the July 2006 Mumbai commuter train bombings yielded 209 deaths. There \nwas no use of unconventional weapons. And it was not the ﬁrst time terrorists had landed by \nsea in Mumbai. Nevertheless, some aspects of this attack were signiﬁcant, namely, its auda-\nc","21":"f this attack were signiﬁcant, namely, its auda-\ncious and ambitious scope, the complexity of the operation, and the diversity of its targets. The \nprolonged nature of the episode, which went on for 60 hours with the steadily mounting death \ntoll, made it a slow-motion shoot-out and siege that mesmerized the world’s news media.\nGiven previous terrorist attacks in India, it was not diﬃcult to situate the motives for the \nMumbai attack in the continuing Islamist terrorist campaign.

More \npragmatically, a terrorist attack on India can exacerbate antagonisms between India’s Hindu \nand Muslim communities and provoke Hindu reprisals that, in turn, divide India and facilitate \nrecruiting by Islamist extremists.\nWhy Mumbai?

US officials hoped that, once immediate te","396":"ttacks. US officials hoped that, once immediate tensions were reduced, Indian and \nPakistani officials would resume their “composite dialogue” fairly quickly, as they had after \nthe Twin Peaks crisis.179\nThe principals’ policy menu did not include evacuating US personnel, dependents, or other \nUS citizens from India. “They did not want to send an alarmist message like that conveyed \nby [then-]Ambassador Bob Blackwill’s ordered evacuation of Embassy dependents in 2002, \nin anticipation of a war,”","397":"sy dependents in 2002, \nin anticipation of a war,” recalled a former US official.180 An alarmist assessment might \nspur preemptive military actions by one side or the other, something Washington sought \nto avoid. \n“Plan A”\nIn the words of a former senior official, “the plan was, first, to show support for India. The \nBush administration was very popular with the GoI, had plenty of capital in the bank. We \nwent as a friend. In Pakistan, the message was to convey the seriousness of the situation, ","398":"e was to convey the seriousness of the situation, \nthat Pakistan needed to ‘own up’ to the LeT.” Neither country wanted a war, and neither \nwanted escalation.

There was no Plan B under consideration. “We didn’t \n“Many in Washington \nbelieved that India and \nPakistan wanted to \navoid war, but no one \nwas willing to leave the \noutcome to chance”\n30  |  The Unfinished Crisis: US Crisis Management After the 2008 Mumbai Attacks\nthink we ","400":"Management After the 2008 Mumbai Attacks\nthink we needed one,” said one former senior official. Others confirm that the NSC \nprincipals did not really consider the possibility that Plan A could fail. Plan A looked \ndo-able.

Each side knew we had some control over the other,” the official concluded.183\nPlan A: High-level Engagement\nTo implement Plan A, the principals turned first to the classic diplomatic strategy that had \nhelped unwind the 2001-2002 confrontation, as well as crises in other parts of the world. \nThe goal was to contact the top leadership quickly and “exert every possible effor","403":"leadership quickly and “exert every possible effort to keep \nthem calm,” one diplomat recalls.184 This entailed visits by senior US officials to each capital \nand coordinated calls to key officials in Islamabad and New Delhi, using assigned call lists.185 \nOne reason for the Bush administration’s return to this formula was that it had worked in \nthe 1999 Kargil and the 2001-2002 Twin Peaks crises, according to a former NSC staffer. A \nsecond was that US officials still “don’t want to be seen as ","404":"that US officials still “don’t want to be seen as taking sides in a military conflict,” \nin contrast to the Cold War period, “even though we are closer to India.”186 A third reason, \nUS officials agreed, was that there are few US policy alternatives in such situations. The \ntoolkit is limited. “The maneuverability of [foreign] policy is super-narrow,” in the words \nof a senior diplomat.187\nAs with the Twin Peaks crisis, the Mumbai attacks were defined from the start as a \ndiplomatic problem; the","405":"fined from the start as a \ndiplomatic problem; there was no consideration of using US troops in South Asia. The \nDepartment of State, the NSC, and the Intelligence Community were therefore the prime \nmovers of the Bush administration’s game plan.

The Mumbai crisis was unique in that it occurred soon \nafter a presidential election, when Bush administration officials were preparing to leave and \nthe Obama ad","564":"fficials were preparing to leave and \nthe Obama administration was organizing to take office. Most of the officials, current and \nformer, who were interviewed for this study agree on the following observations about the \neffect of the transition on management of the Mumbai crisis in Washington.\nFirst, the fact that the crisis began seven weeks before the end of the administration did \nnot dilute the focus or effort of outgoing officials on crisis management. As one said, “We \nall believed that y","565":" management. As one said, “We \nall believed that you had to keep running till you cross the finish line.” Work on the crisis \ncontinued until right before Inauguration Day. Outgoing NSC directors were packing up \ntheir offices at midnight on the final night, one official recalled. 352 This was “a seasoned and \nmature response from a bunch of seasoned actors,” another said. “Gates [who] had been \nthere for two years, Negroponte, Mike Hayden at CIA [were] an all-star team who were very \nsavvy and ","566":" [were] an all-star team who were very \nsavvy and on the same page. Well-rehearsed and practiced.” President Bush, Secretary Rice, \nand National Security Adviser Hadley were all veterans of the Twin Peaks crisis. For them, \nmanaging the Mumbai crisis was “relatively straightforward. There was no question when \nwe went into meetings that we would use the levers and channels we had already established \nto manage the crisis…all the cylinders were working together….We were at the top of our \ngame.”3","567":"rking together….We were at the top of our \ngame.”353\nAs one former senior White House official recalled, “We were still dealing with threats \nright through the inauguration; there was no lag in vigilance” on issues ranging from \nthe Mumbai crisis to the Somalia-related threat warnings during President Obama’s \ninauguration.354 Outgoing Bush administration NSC officials were briefing incoming \nObama administration officials, including the new National Security Advisor, General \n56  |  The Unfinis","568":"onal Security Advisor, General \n56  |  The Unfinished Crisis: US Crisis Management After the 2008 Mumbai Attacks\nJames “Jim” Jones, and Obama’s counterterrorism advisor, John Brennan.355 Secretary Rice \nbriefed Obama directly.356\nSecond, counterterrorism policies, including those relating to the Mumbai attacks and \nthe crisis that followed, changed little after the Obama team came in. Some ascribe this \ncontinuity to the great effort by outgoing officials to distill and pass crisis management \nk","569":"officials to distill and pass crisis management \nknow-how to the Obama team during the transition, including some of their learning on \nIndia-Pakistan crises. “Crises require expertise of their own,” recalled one senior Bush \nadministration official. ”We had a lot of experience by ‘08.

The M","573":"options regarding \nPakistan and Afghanistan. The Mumbai attacks went \nto a back burner. With the passage of time, concern \nabout an Indian military response faded, even though \nPakistani leaders were unwilling or unable to clamp \ndown on or prosecute the attackers. “With the change \nof administration, there was no focus on this at all…on \ngetting the Paks to try these guys [in court],” recalled \na US diplomat. “By the time they focused, Obama that \nis, there were changes politically in the US, I","574":"t \nis, there were changes politically in the US, India, and \nPakistan…to the ‘AfPak’ focus.” One question for India after the transition might have been: \n“how effective is the implied quid pro quo [that] you, India, should not attack, and we, the \nUS, will sort these Paks out?”360\nDid the transition in Washington contribute to the unfinished nature of this crisis and \nthe resulting stalemate?

This offers \nsome reassurance for India and Pakistan….Second- or third-order decisions will vary—e.g, \nwhat should be the tripwires for AmCit","577":" vary—e.g, \nwhat should be the tripwires for AmCit evacuation.”361 The Bush administration’s certainly \nchanged. In 2002, during a critical stage in the Twin Peaks crisis, US Ambassador to India \nRobert Blackwill ordered non-essential personnel to leave New Delhi.” There was no \nconsideration of such an option during the Mumbai crisis.\nTiming mattered less than leverage in the 2008 Mumbai crisis. Washington quite simply “has \nfew levers in Pakistan,” in the words of a former Obama foreign policy","578":"an,” in the words of a former Obama foreign policy advisor. “Those we \nhave are, at best, marginal,” particularly while the US must rely on Pakistani cooperation for \nthe re-supply of NATO forces in Afghanistan.362 Despite the advent of a civilian government \nin Pakistan, it was still the military there that was calling the shots.\nThus the outgoing Bush and incoming Obama administrations were faced with the same \nlimits on leverage with Pakistan as well as the same potential for disruptive acts ","579":"as well as the same potential for disruptive acts in Pakistan, \nIndia, or Afghanistan. As one longtime South Asia-watcher observed: \nUS officials have become acutely aware that the Pakistan military’s dominance will \ncontinue to limit US diplomatic options, even though the military’s relationship with \nmilitant organizations hurts the country’s [Pakistan’s] prospects. The Pakistani military \nhas recognized that explosions in India hurt their country’s potential growth and thus the \nmilitary’s in","580":"try’s potential growth and thus the \nmilitary’s interests. But these explosions and bilateral tension also justify the praetorian \nstate and the military’s grip on the state. They need the Indian threat as much as it limits \nthem. Without India, there is no Pakistan.363 \nAssessing Key Elements of “Plan A” \nTurning now to the Bush administration’s Mumbai crisis management playbook, several \nkey elements were common also to the 1990 crisis, with subsequent refinements during \nthe Kargil and Twin P","581":"bsequent refinements during \nthe Kargil and Twin Peaks crises.
