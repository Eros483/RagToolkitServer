If we could build a steamship with a speed of \n50 knots, then no other steamship could compete with it, and we \nwould have the fastest and largest new steamship in the world.1 \n-Sun Yatsen, Three Principles of","24":"p in the world.1 \n-Sun Yatsen, Three Principles of the People, I924 \nS\nun Yatsen's (1866-1925) famous speeches, 'Ihree Principles of the People, \nwere written in the midst of the reorganization of the Guomindang \nin 1923-24, as China's continued subordination to foreign imperialism \nand the disintegration of the early Republican government demanded the \nreimagining of state and nation.

In envisioning \nthe complete redesign of such a ship, Sun wrested it from this history, \nclaiming the ultimate agency in determining the nation's future. \nThis bo","28":"gency in determining the nation's future. \nThis book examines the steamship and steam navigation in Chinese \nwaters in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as a means of interrogating \nChina's experience of Euro-American and Japanese imperialism. Brought \nto China by European navies and traders as early as the 1830s, steamships \nwere instrumental in the British victory in the First Opium War (1839-42) \nand were subsequently used to transport opium and other goods along \nChina's eastern coast.

Within decades, they became an essential part of \nChina's infrastructure, servicing the foreign trade that extended into the \ninterior and transporting goods for domestic consumption and travelers \nbound for destinations within China. As an enduring mode of expan-\nsion and visible sign of foreign privilege in China, steamships were also \nobjects of conflict and critique, becoming significant sites of nationalist \nmobilization in the twentieth cen","30":" of nationalist \nmobilization in the twentieth century. By 1924, when Sun wrote the \nabove passage, steamships were already ingrained within the physical and \npolitical landscapes of modern China. \nThe formal aspects of China's encounter with Western and Japanese \nimperialism before 1937 are well understood. Most of mainland China \nwas not colonized by a single external power. Instead, a series of unequal \ntreaties signed with several Western powers (and eventually Japan) secured \na framework of","31":"ers (and eventually Japan) secured \na framework of economic and legal privileges for foreign nationals in \nChina while leaving Chinese governments in place. Nearly every account \nof the period lists the treaty terms that infringed on Chinese sovereignty: \nthe opening of treaty ports to foreign residence and trade, extraterritorial \nprotection, fixed tariffs, and the most favored nation clause. Far less \ncertain and more contentious is the question of how treaty provisions \nshaped the daily exper","32":"n of how treaty provisions \nshaped the daily experience of most Chinese and the course of modern \nChinese history. The \"foreign presence\" has been represented at times as \na benign, modernizing influence and at other times as a mode of imperi-\nalist exploitation. It has been viewed as the central motor of change \nwithin modern Chinese history and a limited set of encounters confined \nto the peripheries of a vast empire.5 Steam navigation was an element of \nthe treaty system that bridged its abst","33":"lement of \nthe treaty system that bridged its abstractions and material realities, thus \n~t can illuminate the conceptual and concrete aspects of this regime and \ntts consequences. \nIntroduction \n3 \nTo dare, shipping has played a decidedly minor role in debates over \nimperialism in China. Ir is only occasionally included among the stan-\ndard components of the treaty system. From 1860, however, foreign-flag \nshipping and soon thereafter steam shipping became constitutive elements \nof the treaty s","34":"ping became constitutive elements \nof the treaty system with an incontrovertible significance for material life. \nSteam navigation linked the treaty ports together into a mechanized \ntransport network that predated railway construction by several decades. \nIt brought new possibilities for trade and travel, new opportunities and \noccupations, and new experiences of space and time. It formed a new \nsphere of enterprise characterized by intensive interaction between for-\neign shipping interests and","35":"teraction between for-\neign shipping interests and Chinese clients, partners, and competitors. \nSteamships further furnished novel social spaces that placed disparate \npopulations in close proximity and projected particular views of the so-\ncial order. Although just one aspect of a multifaceted treaty system, the \ndiverse dimensions of steam navigation can enliven our understanding \nof the dynamics of this system and the wider global processes of which it \nwas part. \nSemi-Colonialism and the \nSe","36":" which it \nwas part. \nSemi-Colonialism and the \nSemi-Colonial Conundrum \nThis book uses the term \"semi-colonialism\" to refer to the relations of for-\neign and Chinese power in mainland China under the treaty system. It \nis not a new concept, having a long history and a variety of accrued mean-\nings. Originating with early twentieth-century critics of imperialism \nsuch as J. A. Hobson (1858-1940) and Vladimir Lenin (1870-1924), the \nterm was initially used ro designate those areas of the world-in","37":"ally used ro designate those areas of the world-including \nChina, Persia, Siam, and the Ottoman empire-that were not formal col-\nonies yet were clearly dominated by an external power or powers. In \nLenin's formulation, such places occupied a \"transitional stage\" on the \nway to full colonial rule.6 The same term was deployed within Chinese \nMarxist historiography, in which \"semi-colonial\" (ban zhimindi) is paired \nwith \"semi-feudal\" (ban fangjian) to describe the socioeconomic forma-\ntion that in","38":" to describe the socioeconomic forma-\ntion that inhibited China's transition ro full capiralism.7 It currently re-\nmains a common way to refer to the particular formations of Western \n4 \nIntroduction \nand Japanese imperialist power in China. The term has also had many \ndetractors, from Sun Yatsen, who warned that Chinese people should not \ncomfort themselves with the idea that China was \"only\" a semi-colony \nrather than a colony, to more recent scholarship questioning the term's \ncapacity to cap","39":"cholarship questioning the term's \ncapacity to capture the full range of phenomena resulting from China's \nencounter with imperialism.8 Despite this range of interpretations, my \nchoice to use the term is deliberate. I find it uniquely useful in that, keep-\ning both sides of the hyphen under active consideration, it can encompass \nthe particularity of China's experience, its comparability with colonial \ncontexts, and its enmeshment within the process of the global ascent of \nEuropean empires in ","40":"cess of the global ascent of \nEuropean empires in the latter nineteenth century.9 \nMy reading of the term is an effort to untangle the conundrum that \nprevails within contemporary scholarship on China's experience of im-\nperialism: whether this experience can be understood through the same \nframeworks as colonialism or whether it was exceptional enough to re-\nquire its own concepts and tools. Th.is debate is particularly pronounced \namong China scholars engaged with the fields of colonial and po","41":"cholars engaged with the fields of colonial and postcolo-\nnial studies-the multidisciplinary efforts of the past forty years to ex-\nplicate the complex relations between European expansion to other parts \nof the world and European notions of modernity.

Tani Barlow's essay \"Colonialism's \nCareer in Postwar China Studies,\" for example, even as it contends that \nscholarly practice has obscured the relevance of colonialism to Chinese \nhistory, distinguishes China from those places that were \"outright Euro-\npean possessions\" and calls instead for an \"interrogation of the complex-\nity of China's semicolonialism.''10 Bar","43":"e complex-\nity of China's semicolonialism.''10 Barlow's analysis shows that the past \ncategories and paradigms of academic China studies-such as a modern-\nization approach that took indigenous \"tradition\" as its foil and a later \nemphasis on the economic impact of imperialism-were nearly identical \nto those used to study the colonial world, yet concludes that the \"semi-\" \nqualifier remains necessary to account for specific conditions in China.11 \nOther studies take this claim of difference furth","44":"\nOther studies take this claim of difference further, emphasizing that \nthe outcomes-most often the cultural effects-of semi-colonial rule in \nIntroduction \n5 \nChina were distinct from those observed under colonial rule, most often \nusing British India as a point of comparison.

In Shih 's argument, \nthere is the subtle suggestion that this difference made Chinese intellec-\ntuals less effective critics of colonialism in ","46":"c-\ntuals less effective critics of colonialism in that they did not produce an \n\"authentic critique of post-Enlightenment rationality.\" 12 Bryna Good-\nman's article on the celebration of the 1893 Jubilee of Queen Victoria in \nShanghai similarly links the form of external control in China to out-\ncomes in the cultural sphere. Criticizing other scholars' failure to \"sub-\nstantively distinguish semicolonialism from colonialism,\" she argues that \nthe presence of Chinese sovereignty and the limited e","47":" presence of Chinese sovereignty and the limited exercise of foreign \npower in nineteenth-century China indeed made semi-colonialism qual-\nitatively different from colonialismP Her analysis concludes with the \nstatement that in nineteenth-century Shanghai, Chinese did not view for-\neigners and their interactions with them \"in terms of anything resem-\nbling colonized subjectivities.\"14 In both of these studies, the specific mode \nof foreign political control is directly linked to cultural outcome","48":"cal control is directly linked to cultural outcomes, there-\nfore demanding an accounting of the specific nature of semi-colonialism. \nIn his book English Lessons, James Hevia provides the most explicit \narticulation of an opposing position, rejecting the need to calibrate the \ndifference between colonialism and semi-colonialism. Hevia disaggregates \nwhat he calls colonialism's \"hegemonic projects'' from forms of colonial \nrule, pointing out that political control was only one aspect of European ","49":"political control was only one aspect of European \nempire-building.

A problem with the op-\nposing positions is that they hinge on two different bur overlapping con-\nc","52":"they hinge on two different bur overlapping con-\nceptions of colonialism: first, colonialism as rule by a colonial state, and \nsecond, colonialism as the process of the imposition of European (or \nEuropean-derived) forms of power/knowledge (the \"hegemonic projects\" \nof Hevia's argument). The scholarly practice of colonial studies over the \npreceding decades provides some explanation for the oscillation between \nthese concepts. As Frederick Cooper has observed, one of the primary \ncontributions o","53":" has observed, one of the primary \ncontributions of colonial studies was the \"unbounding\" of colonialism, \nthe shift of the focus ofinquiry away from the processes of acquiring and \nadministering colonies to the dissemination of categories of Western \npower/knowledge, a shift that allowed colonial studies to offer critiques of \nthe universalizing ideas of Western modernity and resist the idea that co-\nlonialism came to an end once former colonies achieved independence.18 \nYet as Cooper and other","54":" achieved independence.18 \nYet as Cooper and others have noted, arguments for this unbounded co-\nlonialism have been overwhelmingly made through research into areas \nformally integrated into European empires, such as British India, French \nAfrica, and Dutch Indonesia, making it difficult to disaggregate this more \ndiscursive definition of colonialism from rule by a colonial state.19 \nI use \"semi-colonialism\" in this book not to insist on difference but \nto make use of the term's particular and c","55":"ce but \nto make use of the term's particular and comparative attributes.

From the heights of the conference's power in 1882-95 to the \nintense competition it faced from new companies in 1895-1913, it remained \nthe central structure of the steam shipping business in Chinese waters. \nAt the time, Swire may not have bee","720":"inese waters. \nAt the time, Swire may not have been able ro predict the expansion of \nJapanese shipping companies in China and their eventual place along-\nside the Three Companies. He also mighr not have anticipated the change \nin the fortunes of the China Merchants Company: the largest company \nin 1882 was in a subordinate position in 1913. \nThe conference's history encapsulates the paradoxes of semi-colonial \ncollaboration.

This \nforwarded British expansionism by giving the British companies the op-\nportunity to connect and leverage other resources of the British empire \nto their shipping concerns and extend from there, magnifying the differ-\nences in access to these worldwide resources between themselves and the \nChina Merchants Company. At the same time, the conference's stability \nwas also a lifeline for an increa","722":"nce's stability \nwas also a lifeline for an increasingly beleaguered China Merchants \nCompany facing internal turmoil and a loss of support from the Qing \nstate. Therefore, it is possible to say that the conference aided the expan-\nsionist project and that it helped maintain the China Merchants fleet as \nan expression of indigenous sovereignty. These two aspects may appear \nincompatible, but under this collaborative mechanism, they occurred \nsimultaneously. \nThe China Merchants Company's perform","723":"ltaneously. \nThe China Merchants Company's performance in the late nineteenth \nand early rwentieth centuries might be found wanting in entrepreneurial \nor nationalist terms, yet the significance of its long-term and central \n,l]h \n130 \nThe Shipping Conference \npresence in coastal and river shipping should not be underestimated. \nThe sharpest contrast between the steam shipping businesses in semi-\ncolonial China and colonial India was that British domination of the \nIndian coast was nearly comple","724":" domination of the \nIndian coast was nearly complete. As it grew with the support of its gov-\nernment mail contracts, the British India Company was able to almost \ncompletely eradicate Indian capital from coastal shipping.

This absence set an extremely high bar for Indian \nshipping enterprises as they tried to break into coastal and overseas lines \ndominated by the British India Company or Briti","725":"s \ndominated by the British India Company or British-led conferences. At \ntimes, the colonial government intervened to support British shipping \ninterests against Indian ones. Indian entrepreneurs faced both commer-\ncial and political barriers when they tried to enter the shipping field in \nthe late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. \nAs the British India Company's power grew, it tolerated a small op-\nposition, forging agreements and dividing routes with a few companies. \nThese \"opponents","726":"ing routes with a few companies. \nThese \"opponents,\" however, were most often British firms, including the \nGlasgow-based Todd, Findlay & Co. in Burma and the Liverpool-based \nTurner, Morrison & Co. in the Bay of Bengal.125 The one exception to \nthis rule was the Bombay Steam Navigation Company, with whom the \nBritish India Company shared the Bombay-Karachi route. Originally \nfounded by Indian merchants in the 1840s, this company was taken over \nby British owners in the 1860s and reorganized onc","727":"by British owners in the 1860s and reorganized once again under both \nBritish and Indian partners in 1869. The company's Indian ownership \nproved a liability when it bid against the British India Company for the \nBombay-Karachi mail contract in 1884. The Bombay Steam Navigation \nCompany submitted a lower bid, but the post office official who made \nthe decision deemed the company \"unreliable\" precisely because it had \nIndian partners. He granted the contract to the British India Company, \nwhich h","728":"he contract to the British India Company, \nwhich had already held it for many years.126 \nThe overseas lines that connected Indian ports to others in Asia were \ncontrolled by British-led conferences that could set unfavorable terms for \nthe Indian businesses that relied on them for transport. In the mid-189os, \nIndian industrialist J. N.

In 1894, Tata tried \nto evade the conference","730":"ates. In 1894, Tata tried \nto evade the conference by forming an alliance with Japanese shipping \ncompanies and cotton goods exporters. He went to Japan and met with \nthe Nippon Yusen Kaisha and the Japanese Spinners Association, pro-\nposing a competing shipping line run jointly by Tata and Nippon Yusen. \nTata secured promises from Indian shippers to provide guaranteed cargo \nfor the new firm, and Nippon Yusen secured similar promises from Japa-\nnese thread exporters. This new collaborative line","731":"nese thread exporters. This new collaborative line was met with a rate \nwar by the conference companies-which offered to carry cotton yarn to \nJapan free of charge-and attempts to discredit its ships on the insur-\naoce market.

In 1908, \nPillai was arrested for attending a political meeting, after which the com-\npany failed. 131 \nIt was nor until after World War I that Indian-backed shipping com-\npanies were able to establish themselves as competitors to the British \nIndia Company on major routes or challenge conference control of over-\nseas lines. This exclusion was not limited to shipp","735":"eas lines. This exclusion was not limited to shipping, but was a part of \n132 \nThe Shipping Conference \nwhat Rajat K. Ray has called the \"division of economic space\" on the sub-\ncontinent in which British businesses headquartered in Britain dominated \ntrade, finance, and shipping, making it difficult for Indians to enter into \nthese fields.132 In China, the division was not absolute, as the China \nMerchants Company remained one of the leading carriers on the Yangzi \nand coast.

The company's lack of overseas connections may have con-\nfined it to Chinese waters, but within them it maintained this position \nuntil 1937.

Steamship travel was not a universal expe-\nrience in nineteenth- and twentieth-century China, but it was common \nenough that many people expe","739":"a, but it was common \nenough that many people experienced and engaged with this space. \nOne of the most unmistakable features of the steamship space was \nits obvious hierarchies of racial and class privilege in work and travel.

In \nthis space, race was expressed as competence, both technical and cultural. \nBoundaries were enforced out of anxieties over proximity and intimacy \nbetwee","742":"t of anxieties over proximity and intimacy \nbetween races. Not only were similar organizations of social space pres-\nent in colonial contexts, it was also consonant with racial discourses and \nideologies that exceeded the boundaries of formal colonies. The case of \nthe steamship space indicates that in spite of the particular dynamics and \ncharacteristics of semi-colonialism, China could not be insulated or dis-\ntanced from the hegemonic projects of colonial power/knowledge. \nThis investigation ","743":" of colonial power/knowledge. \nThis investigation of steamship space is more specific to China in its \nexcavation of how these particular hierarchies were constructed and per-\npetuated on steamships in Chinese waters. Steamship companies did not \narticulate rules or principles that justified the organization of the space; \nexplanations must instead be sought through the structures and practices \nthat undergirded it, and these were often particular to the steam ship-\nping field in China. The para","744":"r to the steam ship-\nping field in China. The parallel management structures of the major \nsteamship companies, particularly in their relations with Chinese mar-\nkets for labor, cargo, and passengers, provide one type of explanation. An-\nother significant factor was the precedence of foreign (British or U.S.) \nmodels of company organization and their entrenchment as standards \nthrough the conference system. The conference's demand for commen-\nsurability among participating companies discouraged ","745":"ability among participating companies discouraged challenges to such \nstandards. Apart from these structures were the daily practices-formal \nand informal, consistent and inconsistent-of overseeing disparate spaces \naboard the steamship. \nThe perceptions and interpretations of the steamship space by those \nwho encountered it are an additional means of assessing its meaning and \nimpact. A common interpretation of the steamship's social space in many \ncontexts emphasized its replication or reflect","746":"ny \ncontexts emphasized its replication or reflection of the outside world \nwithin the ship's hold: transatlantic steamships were known as \"floating \ncities,\" for example, and Louis Hunter called the U.S. river steamboat a \n\"world in miniature,\" where \"the essential processes of living went on, \nkeyed to a higher pitch than the ordinary course oflandbound existence.\"' \nb \nThe Steamship as Social Space \n135 \nIn contrast, Michel Foucault saw ships-among other social spaces-as \n\"heterotopias\": real","747":"among other social spaces-as \n\"heterotopias\": real spaces can challenge or disrupt the social relations of \nthe culture that produces them. Although he identified gardens, prisons, \nbrothels, and boarding schools as examples ofheterotopia, Foucault called \nthe ship the \"heterotopia par excellence.\"2 In late nineteenth- and early \ntwentieth-century China, journalists and travelers echoed this range of \ninterpretation in their writings. Many foreign travelers wrote about steam-\nships as \"worlds in","748":"n travelers wrote about steam-\nships as \"worlds in miniature\" that confirmed their expectations of the \nsocial order and their place within it. Nineteenth-century Chinese jour-\nnalists furnished a very different view as they worked to fathom the \nsteamship space-particularly the accommodation provided to Chinese \npassengers-as it completely confounded their expectations of social rela-\ntions. By the late 1920s, journalists' prior confusion with the treatment \nof Chinese passengers aboard steamsh","749":"he treatment \nof Chinese passengers aboard steamships had given way to a more politi-\ncized interpretation in which the steamship space had become emblem-\natic of China's geopolitical condition, and encounters with it opened paths \nto nationalist awakening. \nShared Practices: 7he Organization and \nManagement of Steamship Companies \nThis chapter's identification of a single, characteristic social space of the \nsteamship in Chinese waters may appear to be an oversimplification given \nthe multinati","750":"r to be an oversimplification given \nthe multinational origins of the four major steamship companies. Al-\nthough national origins do account for some variation, the more striking \nresult of an investigation of steamships' social space is the overwhelming \nparallels between the ships of the Four Companies. Despite the various \nflags they flew, the major companies were organized and managed in \nsimilar ways, and these practices structured the social spaces of their \nships. This consistent organiza","751":"l spaces of their \nships. This consistent organization derived from several factors, most \nprominently the demands of the shipping business in China but also the \nhistorical development of the business and the disciplinary institution of \nthe shipping conference. \nSherman Cochran's study of British, Japanese, and Chinese busi-\nnesses in Republican China criticizes the notion that different national \n136 \nThe Steamship as Social Space \ncultures produce characteristic business organizations, speci","752":"oduce characteristic business organizations, specifically taking \non the argument that Western and Japanese businesses tended to be or-\nganized along hierarchical, corporate lines, while Chinese businesses \ntended to be organized through lateral social networks.

These firms relied \non social networks to recruit their core managers and to establish pres-\nences in Chinese markets. This was a low-cost, minimalist management \nstrategy that allowed the companies to extend their operations over as \nbroad a geographi","754":"extend their operations over as \nbroad a geographical area as possible. Albert Feuerwerker's argument that \nthe failure of enterprises like the China Merchants Company to indus-\ntrialize China can be attributed to the \"deficien[cy] in the rationalized \norganization, functional specialization, and impersonal discipline asso-\nciated with the development of modern industry in the West,\" would \ntherefore apply equally to the British steamship companies.4 The latest \narrival, the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha","755":"es.4 The latest \narrival, the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, adopted some corporate hierarchies in \nits upper management, but like the other companies relied heavily on net-\nworks to make inroads into Chinese markets. \nChina Navigation, Indo-China, the China Merchants Company, and \nthe Nisshin Kisen Kaisha employed a few core managers who oversaw \nthe company's operations from select locations, generally a main office \nin Shanghai and branch offices in other treaty ports.

There was very little possibility for mobility between these lev-\nels of ship's crews. This characterisric hierarchy derived from rhe condi-\ntions of steam navigation in general and from the shared practices of the \nFour Companies in Chinese waters.

The broker, rather \nthan the company, was the worker's primary employer. Companies paid \nwages to the broker rather than to the individual crew members. Work-\ners paid the broker a fee~sometimes the equivalent of several months' \nwages-for a place on a crew, and the broker could deduct payments from \ntheir monthly earnings toward that amount. Some brokers deepened this \ndebt relationship by charging crews for housing and entertainment on-\nshore ","794":"ing crews for housing and entertainment on-\nshore and advancing more loans. 21 Chinese crews were paid much less \nthan comparable crews composed of Europeans; they were understood \nto require less space on board the ship and less expense to feed.

As in other \nsectors of treaty-porr labor markets, steamship crews tended to hail from \na single native place and share that tie with the broker. Yangzi River crews, \nfor example, were usually signed in Shanghai and composed of natives \nof the Ningbo area of coastal Zhej","796":"sed of natives \nof the Ningbo area of coastal Zhejiang Province. 23 Such ties allowed for \nready communication of the skills and protocol necessary for the work \nand helped maintain discipline and control within the crew, as each \nworker was involved in kinship or other obligational relationships that \nmight extend back to his home area. Like the use of compradors in other \naspects of the shipping business, hiring crews through brokers allowed \nthe steamship companies to access Chinese labor at ","797":"he steamship companies to access Chinese labor at low cost. Despite the \nphysical proximiry of crew members at all levels, there were few oppor-\ntunities for Chinese crew members to acquire the skills necessary to ad-\nvance to technically skilled positions.

Although there may have been few qualified Chinese navigators in \nthe 1860s and 1870s, after that time, merchant shipping companies, par-\nticularly the China Merchants Company, could have hired former Qing \nnaval officers in such positions. A 1908 Ministry of Posts and Communi-\ncations survey shows that such a circumstance was very rare. At that time \nall thirty-one China Merchants Company ships had European captains, \nand the vast majority of officers ","800":"pean captains, \nand the vast majority of officers and engineers were also European. Of \n179 technical personnel, there were only 4 Chinese that held the position \nof third or fourth engineer.25 One S. C.

The prevalence of \nforeign-flag companies in Chinese waters thus meant that those in com-\nmand were often foreign nationals, but shipping firms did not always fol-\nlow these laws in China.

When the China Naviga-\ntion Company sent its first steamships ro China in 1872, it replaced the \nBritish captains that commanded the ships on their outward voyage with \ncaptains that had been hired away from existing Yang2i River steamship \ncompanies, several of whom wereAmericans.27 This practice was so prev-\nalent that in 1877, the U.S. consul-general in Shanghai apologized to \nU.S. ship owners for enforcing the law requiring captains and officers to \nbe citizen","803":"law requiring captains and officers to \nbe citizens, acknowledging that it \"interfered with American trade inter-\nests in China.\"28 In China, it was common for U.S. companies to employ \nBritish captains or British companies to employ Norwegian captains, but \nsuch reciprocity was not extended to Chinese mariners. \nThe Steamship as Social Space \n145 \nInsurance standards were another factor that excluded Chinese from \nthese positions. The extended employment of European technical person-\nnel in the","804":"mployment of European technical person-\nnel in the China Merchants Company is often cited as an example of the \nmismanagement of the company, as the salaries of foreign employees were \none of the company's largest expenses.29 Yet over the China Merchants \nhistory, there was no shortage of proposals for replacing European cap-\ntains and engineers with Chinese. The earliest was a plan composed by \nTang Tingshu and Xu Run in 1873, to train \"capable Chinese\" to take \nover these positions from Europe","805":"Chinese\" to take \nover these positions from Europeans, but the managers acknowledged \nthat such a program was contingent on the company becoming self-\ninsuring because the foreign insurance firms on which the company re-\nlied would not insure ships commanded by Chinese.30 The failure of the \nshort-lived Renhe Insurance Company (see chapter 3), and the company's \nreturn to foreign insurers likely halted this plan.31 In the 1890s, the China \nMerchants manager Zheng Guanying (1842-1921) proposed a ","806":"nts manager Zheng Guanying (1842-1921) proposed a similar plan \nto recruit and train former naval officers and Chinese with experience on \nships for these posts, since he found that the company's foreign employ-\nees were paid at least eight times what a Chinese would be paid under \nthese circumstances.32 After the company became a private concern in \n1912, its shareholders voted to replace European captains with Chinese, \nbut this decision was blocked by the company's board of directors, who \nar","807":"ocked by the company's board of directors, who \nargued that it would be too difficult for the company to insure its ships.33 \nSimilar resolutions passed in 1919 and 1924 resulted in the hiring of only \nfour Chinese captains for the company's Yangzi River fleet.34 Through-\nout this period, it was clear that company leaders were well aware of the \ndesirability of replacing their European staff with Chinese, but insurance \ndifficulties were the obstacle cited most often. \nThe rationale behind the f","808":"acle cited most often. \nThe rationale behind the foreign insurance companies' refusal to in-\nsure ships commanded by Chinese is not entirely clear, but a significant \ndifference between European/Japanese and Chinese mariners during this \nperiod was that Europeans and Japanese could obtain formal certifica-\ntions from their home governments, whereas neither the Qing nor the \nearly Republican governments had made legal provisions for certifying \nChinese as merchant steamship captains and engineers","809":"inese as merchant steamship captains and engineers. The few Chinese \nwho served in such positions before the 1920s were graduates of naval \nacademies or navy veterans.35 It was not until 1929 that the Nationalist \nThe Steamship as Social Space \ngovernment set up certification procedures for merchant seamen.36 If \nthere was a stereotype that Chinese were less able commanders than were \nEuropeans, the long absence of a certification process almost certainly \nreinforced it. Many of the small Chines","810":"certainly \nreinforced it. Many of the small Chinese shipping companies started \naround the turn of the twentieth century hired Chinese of uncertain qual-\nifications to command their ships, and the number of accidents that \nresulted from inexperienced captains and engineers deepened the asso-\nciation between a foreign captain and a ''safe\" ship.37 As late as 1931, some \ninsurance companies still refused to insure Upper Yangzi ships unless they \nwere commanded by Europeans.38 \nThe China Merchants ","811":"re commanded by Europeans.38 \nThe China Merchants Company remained dependent on foreign in-\nsurance and foreign technical personnel throughout this period, despite \nits leaders' awareness of the problems these caused for the company.

This type of oblique racial dis-\ncourse was not unique to China: Ann Laura Stoler has observed that \ncolonial laws tended to distinguish European citizens from colonial sub-\njects not through their physiological characteristics but through perceived \ncultural competencies. 82 \nUnderscoring the point that deportment and dress were means of rep-\nresenting race rather than specific criteria for inclusion in the space are \ninstances in which ","890":"or inclusion in the space are \ninstances in which even the most \"Westernized\" Chinese were barely tol-\nerated in the foreign first class. A request from one of Butterfield & \nSwire's Chinese compradors for steamship tickets for his children illus-\ntrates the contradictions of this articulation of race. The comprador asked \nfor foreign first-class accommodation for his children's return from mis-\nsionary schools in Shanghai, since \"they have to a great extent been \nbrought up to foreign ways.\" He","891":"great extent been \nbrought up to foreign ways.\" He also suggested that they be assigned to \ncabins in the hall near the ship comprador's room rather than in the main \nsaloon because there \"they would not be in the way of foreign passengers \nor feel any restraint.\"83 The comprador makes an argument for his \nchildren's qualifications for admission to the space-their familiarity with \n\"foreign ways\"-yet acknowledges the probability that their presence \nwould be unwelcome and they would be made awar","892":"ce \nwould be unwelcome and they would be made aware of it. \nThe possibility of social contact between Europeans and Chinese was \na vexed enough problem on British steamships, but evidence of sexual in-\ntimacy between races was even more intolerable.

Other Hong Kong Chinese witnesses-including bar-\nrister Wu Tingfang (1842-1922)-testified that they had eaten at the \nIchang's cabin table in the past, and thus the lawyers argued that Cheong \nhad every reason to expect that he would be served there. When asked to \nexplain the inconsistency, the Ichang's captain replied that he had only \never allowed three Chinese passe","903":"that he had only \never allowed three Chinese passengers to eat at the cabin table: one had \nbeen accompanied by a European and the other two had been \"known \nto him.\" His lawyer elaborated on this point, explaining that \"the Cap-\ntain had a perfect right to refuse any one a seat at the cabin table,\" and \n\"the question of admitting Chinese to the cabin indiscriminately was a \nvery serious one,\" citing a case in which Chinese pirates had boarded a \nship dressed as well-to-do passengers.

In-\nstead, the captain, the judge, and the company uniformly defended the \ncaptain's personal authority to manage the space as he wished. In con-\ntrast to a public space in which principles of exclusion might need to be \narticulated and justified, the captain's table was deemed private, and thus \nhis criteria","910":"s table was deemed private, and thus \nhis criteria for exclusion remained so as well.

Second, \nthe accommodation was run by a Chinese comprador who presumably \ncatered to the needs of Chin","971":"rador who presumably \ncatered to the needs of Chinese passengers, thus the conditions in the Chi-\nnese accommodation were easily naturalized as the \"preferences\" of these \ntravelers. When foreign observers remarked on the dearly substandard \nconditions in the Chinese accommodation, they often attributed them \nto preference. In explaining how compradors packed passengers into the \naccommodation, for example, a China Navigation captain remarked that \nChinese passengers \"had a fairly thin time of i","972":"t \nChinese passengers \"had a fairly thin time of it,\" but added: \"But Chi-\nnese passengers were basically quite happy.

Extending authority over Chinese shipping was \nan important part of the Nationalist government's nation-building and \nstate-building efforts: it established control over legal and administrative \nstructures for shipping and claimed the roles of protector of Chinese ship-\nping and promoter of China's shipping autonomy.

Although specific measures ofNanjing's ship-\nping program occasionally met with opposition from ship owners, they \noverwhelmingly welcomed its intervention, hoping that state support \nwould allow their businesses to survive difficult economic conditions and \nintense competition with foreign companies.

These regim","1205":"ut enjoyed \nconsiderable independence. These regimes could complicate the imple-\nmentation of state policy and challenge Nanjing's claims to the center. \n218 \nNanjing and Chongqing \nIn one case, a semi-independent militarist regime pursued its own, nearly \nsimultaneous program of shipping rights recovery.

The parallel programs underscore the concrete significance \nof shipping to questions of sovereignty, both loca","1207":"of shipping to questions of sovereignty, both local and national. \nThe nearly simultaneous pursuit of shipping rights recovery programs \nin these different contexts had paradoxical results. On one hand, the \nindependent actions of militarist regimes like Liu Xiang's undermined \nNanjing's claim to represent the central government of China.

In this context as well, Minsheng's \neffort to reimagine the passenger accommodation of its steamships was \nthe most distinctive. From 1933 onward, Minsheng's new passenger spaces \narticulated a critique of prevailing practice in the shipping field and used \nthe attractive spaces of its ships as didactic tools to","1413":"ttractive spaces of its ships as didactic tools to reinforce a nationalist \nmessage and mold new forms of \"modern\" behavior for the traveling \npublic. \nBy 1937 the uniform, characteristic social space of the earlier period \nhad been replaced by multiple \"new steamships,\" displaying different \ndegrees and types of change.

Equally significant, \nhowever, was the China Merchants Company's deepening ties to the Na-\ntionalist government. Even before its full nationalization in 1933, both \nthe government and advocates of shipping nationalism viewed China \nMerchants as a \"","1429":"hipping nationalism viewed China \nMerchants as a \"national\" concern that should lead the charge for ship-\nping autonomy.

Min-\nsheng's methods provided a model, and the New Life Movement provided \nsupport and sometimes muscle to other Chinese steamship companies to \ntransform along these lines. \nIn spring 1935, New Life Movement leaders traveled to Shanghai \nand met with the heads of Chinese shipping firms (such as Liu Hong-\nsheng, Yu Xiaqing, and Lu Zuofu) and with General Yang Hu to discuss \nhow to ","1520":"uofu) and with General Yang Hu to discuss \nhow to use the movement's resources to address the teaboy problem. \nNew Life organizers voiced their approval of Lu Zuofu's methods of \nselecting, managing, and training reaboys as \"very concrete and in line \nThe ''New Steamship\" \nwith the spirit\" of their movement. They made recommendations that were \nbased on Minsheng's policies, including the abolition of the comprador \nsystem, the selection of employees through examinations, the provision \nof system","1521":"ees through examinations, the provision \nof systems of advancement, and training in specific work skills and gen-\neral knowledge of national defense, economy, and shipping. 84 New Life \nfurther advocated that steamship companies adopt methods of job evalu-\nation, rewards and punishments for performance, and extra learning op-\nportunities to develop work as well as artistic and athletic skills. 85 Later \nthat year, the Ministry of Communications ordered the National China \nMerchanrs Company and p","1522":"rdered the National China \nMerchanrs Company and private Chinese shipping firms to implemenr \nthe New Life Movement's recommendations on board their ships. 86 \nThe ministry's order was ambitious, because it demanded the thor-\nough reorganization of most Chinese shipping companies.

In February 1936, Liu Hongsheng's successor, Cai \nZengji, tried to replace ship compradors on Yangzi steamers with sala-\nried pursers. Like Liu before him, Cai found it nearly impossible to get \nrid of the existing compradors, and eventually he reappointed them \nunder new terms, renaming them \"business managers.\"93 An inspection \nreport from later that year warned that since so many of the old compra-\ndors remained in these p","1528":"o many of the old compra-\ndors remained in these positions, the company needed to be vigilant \nagainst the reappearance of old abuses.

It provided derailed instructions for \npassenger behavior, exhorting them to not occupy benhs other than their \nown, to maintain public order, to refrain from disturbing o","1569":"aintain public order, to refrain from disturbing others' sleep, \nand to eat meals only at prescribed times. It also encouraged passengers \nto take advantage of the ship's services and amenities, inviting them to \nuse the ship's stock of medicines if they fell sick, borrow books and mag-\nazines, and buy snacks, fruit, and coffee from the ship's \"consumption \ncooperative\" (xiaofei hezuo she).

He mentioned the new baths on \nMinsheng ships as an especially welcome addition for trav","1574":"g ships as an especially welcome addition for travel in the sum-\nmer heat. Beyond this comparison, the narrative also made an argument \nfor the practical and political attractions of Minsheng ships for students \nin particular, explaining in detail how to obtain a 20 percent student \ndiscount on direct voyages from Shanghai to Chongqing. He contended \nthat Minsheng ships were a natural choice for patriotic students since \n\"we young students are not like cold-blooded animals or shameless \nmerchant","1575":"t like cold-blooded animals or shameless \nmerchants\"-who would travel on foreign ships rather than Chinese. \nChen's account describes how the voyage transformed his classmates' be-\nhavior. He writes that although there were some who could afford to travel \nin first or second class, they \"broke out of their 'young master', 'prince-\nling', and 'dandy' habits and came back and forth to visit their friends in \nthe third-class cabin,\" suggesting chat the openness of the Minsheng pas-\nsenger accommoda","1576":"the openness of the Minsheng pas-\nsenger accommodation allowed student camaraderie to overcome class \ndivisions.124 This narrative was clearly company-approved advertising, but \nit provides a very dear encapsulation of the company's intentions in re-\nforming its passenger accommodation: the service and amenities would \nattract passengers, but the travel experience would also teach chem new \nways of interacting and reinforce the bonds between them. \nIn a context in which many companies were attem","1577":". \nIn a context in which many companies were attempting to modify \nor update their passenger spaces, the Minsheng Company completely re-\nimagined the relationship between the Chinese passenger and the steam-\nship company. In contrast to the Chinese accommodation of the earlier \nconfiguration of passenger space, in which Chinese passengers were at the \nmercy of ship compradors and thus beyond the company's authority, \nMinsheng's passengers were fully integrated into the company's and each \n286 \nT","1578":"lly integrated into the company's and each \n286 \nThe \"New Steamship\" \nship's organization. Minsheng's guarantee of a berth to all passengers in \nall classes of course responded to a long-standing passenger complaint ex-\nacerbated by the teaboy crisis, but it required that the ship's management \ncount and account for each passenger. Furthermore, passengers were en-\ncouraged to seek help from and interact with Minsheng staff, especially \nthe teaboys. In turn, teaboys were trained to act as the key","1579":"s. In turn, teaboys were trained to act as the key point of con-\ntact between the company and the public, providing services, travel in-\nformation, and information about the company. In Minsheng's focus on \npassenger service and its goal to improve the Sichuan economy through \ntourism, it acknowledged their economic value and potential contribu-\ntion of passengers. Ultimately, the dignifying of Chinese passengers on \nMinsheng ships was a means to attract them and a means of persuading \nthem to a","1580":" attract them and a means of persuading \nthem to adopt the values promoted by the company, ranging from the \nchoice of more wholesome entertainments on board to the ethics of na-\ntionalist consumption. \nBy the mid-1930s, the uniform, characteristic social space of the steam-\nship in Chinese waters in evidence at earlier rimes had disappeared. From \nthe late 1920s onward, Chinese and foreign companies had begun to \nquestion and modify that space in response to new opportunities, crises, \nand the ","1581":"n response to new opportunities, crises, \nand the changing demands of passengers. The factors that had underlay the \nuniform social space, such as the preference for foreign technical person-\nnel, contracting the Chinese accommodation to compradors, and provid-\ning separate accommodation for foreigners and Chinese, were now very \nmuch under question, with different companies arriving at different so-\nlutions. Rather than one characteristic social space of the steamship, there \nwere now many alte","1582":" space of the steamship, there \nwere now many alternatives. \nIn a political climate characterized not only by Chinese nationalism \nbut also by nationalist nation-building, Chinese steamship companies \nbegan to take more extreme and often costly measures to distance their \ncompanies from this earlier social space. Such departures dispelled the \nprior mode of collaboration in which the China Merchants Company re-\nproduced the characteristic social space and its associations. Under these \nnew condi","1583":"space and its associations. Under these \nnew conditions, a significantly larger group of Chinese shipping firms was \nnot nearly as bound by the false symmetry of the shipping conference. \nWith the infrastructure, exhortation, and occasional support provided by \nTransformatiom of Social Space \nthe Nationalist government, Chinese firms prioritized the transformation \nof this space. \nWithin this broader context of change in the shipping field, Min-\nsheng's \"new steamship\" stands out as the sharpest","1584":"sheng's \"new steamship\" stands out as the sharpest rejoinder to the earlier \norganization of steamship space. The spaces of this new steamship chal-\nlenged nearly every element of the earlier space: the rigid racial lines in \nsteamship crews, contracting out the Chinese accommodation, and the \nimplicit racial segregation of classes. In focusing on hiring skilled Chi-\nnese, rejecting the use of ship compradors, integrating teaboys into the \ncompany, and leveling disparities in amenities and servi","1585":"y, and leveling disparities in amenities and service among pas-\nsenger classes, Minsheng's new steamship reformulated rather than mod-\nified earlier practices. In doing so, the company made spaces that had \npreviously showcased Chinese deficiencies into models of expertise and \norder, making an argument for Chinese competencies against the seem-\ningly immutable associations visible on other ships. Minsheng's new \nsteamship made a clear case for Chinese competencies, whether through \nits employme","1586":"hinese competencies, whether through \nits employment of exclusively Chinese technical personnel, its disciplined \nworkforce, or its well-ordered and comfortable ships. \nAs chapter 4 argued, for Chinese observers the steamship had rarely \nreflected familiar or expected social relations and had more often forced \na questioning of those expectations. Minsheng's \"new steamship\" took \nthe steamship's unstable relationship with outer reality in a new direction, \ncreating instead an idealized space of ","1587":"irection, \ncreating instead an idealized space of aspiration. In Foucault's words, it \nwas a \"heterotopia of compensation,\" a projection of a future Chinese \nnation that was orderly, disciplined, unified, and incontrovertibly mod-\nern.125 Furthermore, Minsheng's new steamship did not just reflect these \nideals, it also provided a means to arrive at them through the persuasion \nand transformation of all those who partook of the space. \nThe new steamship was a microcosm of the Minsheng Company. \nB","1588":"amship was a microcosm of the Minsheng Company. \nBoth ship and company were ethical communities intent on transform-\ning society and nation.
